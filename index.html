    <h4>About me</h4>
    <p>Hi, I'm Sehrish, a passionate BSCS graduate with a love for technology and creativity. I specialize in web development, focusing on building user-friendly and functional digital experiences, and I'm currently exploring the MERN stack to develop modern, scalable applications. I enjoy solving problems, experimenting with ideas, and turning them into real-world solutions. My portfolio reflects my journey of learning, growth, and practical projects that highlight both my technical and creative side. Alongside coding, I also work on personal business ventures to sharpen my entrepreneurial skills. I believe in consistency, focus, and continuous learning, which is why I'm also expanding my expertise in cybersecurity and Python. Creativity lies at the heart of everything I doâ€”whether it's in design, development, or business. My ultimate goal is to grow as a full-stack developer and contribute to impactful projects that make a difference </p>
