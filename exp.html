        My experiences combine both technical learning and entrepreneurial growth. During my BSCS degree, I worked on various academic projects that strengthened my knowledge in programming, databases, and software development. Alongside academics, I explored web development and the MERN stack, building small applications to practice real-world problem solving. I have also gained experience in Python scripting and introductory cybersecurity concepts, expanding my technical expertise beyond the classroom. On the entrepreneurial side, I launched my own small business, where I managed everything from product design and marketing to customer experience, sharpening my skills in creativity, organization, and communication. These experiences have not only shaped my technical foundation but also given me a practical understanding of how to build, manage, and grow impactful projects.
