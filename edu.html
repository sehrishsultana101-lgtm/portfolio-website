    <p>I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (BSCS), where I built a strong foundation in programming, algorithms, databases, and software development. During my studies, I explored various areas of technology, from web development to cybersecurity, which helped me develop both technical expertise and problem-solving skills. My academic journey has shaped my passion for creating practical digital solutions, and I continue to expand my knowledge through self-learning, online courses, and hands-on projects.</p>
