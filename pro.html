    <p> Throughout my journey, I've worked on multiple projects that reflect my learning, creativity, and problem-solving skills. I have developed web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, focusing on creating clean and responsive designs. As part of my MERN stack learning, I am building full-stack applications that integrate MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js to deliver real-world solutions. I have also explored Python projects, including automation scripts and small tools that simplify everyday tasks. Alongside technical projects, I've worked on entrepreneurial initiatives, designing and launching creative products under my brand. Each project has allowed me to apply my skills, learn new technologies, and strengthen my ability to deliver impactful digital solutions.</p>
